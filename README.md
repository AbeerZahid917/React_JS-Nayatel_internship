# React_JS-Nayatel_internship
Full React JS course + project


# Video Two - Starting up + setting up environment:
*check npm -v and npx -v to make sure that they are installed and update if necessary
*run npx create-react-app my-app in the terminal to make a react app for that project/run, cuz otherwise it'll take up unnecessary space
