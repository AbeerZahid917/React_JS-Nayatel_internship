# React_JS-Nayatel_internship
Full React JS course + project


## Video Two - Starting up + setting up environment:
* check **npm -v** and **npx -v** to make sure that they are installed and update if necessary
* run **npx create-react-app my-app** in the terminal to make a react app for that project/run, cuz otherwise it'll take up unnecessary space
* **npx create-react-app <project_name>**, this creates a project file
* component = template sorta
* props = the details themselves
* state = what the details are and mean
* App.js makes the interface; basically what it looks like on the internet
* **npm start** runs it so it shows up on google

### Video 4 - JSX
* its basically html, but class is replaced with classname
* tab = tabIndex
* curly brackets for javascript - hello {name (var above in the code)}
